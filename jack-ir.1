.SH NAME
jack-ir \- JACK Impulse Response Recorder
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B jack_ir
[ \fI\,OPTIONS \/\fR] [ \fI\,OUT-FILE \/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
jack\-ir \- JACK Impulse Response Capture Utility
.PP
This is a standalone JACK application to conveniently capture impulse
responses of external devices.
.PP
The tool supports four different IR file configurations.
.TP
* Mono:
1 in, 1 out
.TP
* Mono\-to\-Stereo:
1 in, 2 out
.TP
* Stereo:
2 in, 2 out
.TP
* True\-Stereo:
2 in, 2 out, 4channels (L\->L, L\->R, R\->L, R\->R)
.PP
The configuration happens indirectly by specifying the capture and playbackports to be used when recording the IR.
The impulse\-response is captured by playing a sine\-sweep chirp via the
configured playback port(s) while recording the response of the system under
test from the configured capture\-port(s).
.PP
The default is to record the response from a 10 sec chirp for 15sec.
For true\-stereo this process is repeated to capture responses for left,and
right channels separately.
.PP
Eventually the IR is computed, normalized and trimmed and saved as wav file.
.PP
Note that this tool is meant for patch\-processing of directly connected
hardware effect units. In order to properly align the IR, it should be used
with latency\-calibrated jackd.
.PP
For capturing rooms, or setups with involving microphones and speakers
do prefer manual capture, equalization and post\-processing e.g. using aliki.

.PP
If the OUT\-FILE parameter is not given, 'ir.wav' is used.
